### Node.js support

The bootstrapper supports having a project loaded as part of a node application. To do so:

- Create a Wasm bootstrapper project, named `MyApp.Wasm`
- Create a Node.js TypeScript project in Visual Studio, named `MyApp.Runner`
- In boostrapper project, add the following :
  ```xml
  <WasmShellDistPath>../MyApp.Runner/app</WasmShellDistPath>
  <WasmShellMode>node</WasmShellMode>
  ```
- In the `app.ts`, add the following:
  ```js
  require("./app/mono");
  ```

Run the application and the main method of the `MyApp.Wasm` will be executed.

The parameters of the node command line are provided to the app's main method when running the app as follows:

```
node app param1 param2
```
