#### Emscripten Linker optimizations flags

When building with AOT or using static linking of bitcode files, the emscripten linker step is enabled and runs optimizations on the generated code.

These steps can be very expensive depending on the final binary size, and disabling those optimizations can be useful to improve the development loop.

To control those optimizations, use the following msbuild property:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <WasmShellEmccLinkOptimization>false</WasmShellEmccLinkOptimization>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This flag is automatically set to `false` when running in a configuration named `Debug`.

The optimization level can be adjusted with the following:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <WasmShellEmccLinkOptimizationLevel>Level3</WasmShellEmccLinkOptimizationLevel>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Allowed values are:
- `None` (`-O0`)
- `Level1` (`-O1`)
- `Level2` (`-O2`)
- `Level3` (`-O3`)
- `Maximum` (`-Oz`)
- Any other value will be passed onto emcripten without modifications

The default value is `Level3`.


### Threads support
> .NET 5/6 for WebAssembly does not support Threading (as of 2021-01-01), enabling this option will result in build errors (missing `dotnet.worker.js` file)

Mono now supports the ability to create threads, in browsers that support it (Chrome 79+, Edge 81+).  Threads are backed by [`atomics` and WebWorkers](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/pthreads.html).

To enable the support, add the following configuration:

```xml
<MonoWasmRuntimeConfiguration>threads-release</MonoWasmRuntimeConfiguration>
```

Note that executing javascript in the context of a thread stays in the worked that is assigned to the thread, thus modifying the DOM from that context will do nothing.

To update the UI, execution will need to go back to the main thread, generally by using a mecanism similar to `System.Threading.Timer` which uses `setTimeout` so execute on the main thread.

### Pre-Compression support

Pre-compression has two modes: 
- In-place, where Brotli compressed files are placed next to original files
- Legacy, where a `web.config` file url rewriter rule is used

The parameters for the pre-compression are as follows:
- `WasmShellGenerateCompressedFiles` which can be `true` or `false`. This property is ignored when building `MonoRuntimeDebuggerEnabled` is set to `true`, and `true` by default when the `Configuration` property is set to `Release`
- `WasmShellCompressedExtension` is an item group which specifies which files to compress. By default `wasm`, `clr`, `js`, `css` and `html` files are pre-compressed. More files can be added as follows:
```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <WasmShellCompressedExtension Include=".db"/>
  </ItemGroup>
```
- `WasmShellBrotliCompressionQuality` which controls the compression quality used to pre-compress the files. The default value is 7.
- `WasmShellCompressionLayoutMode` which can be set to `InPlace` or `Legacy`. If not set and for backward compatility reasons, `Legacy` is automatically selected if a `web.config` file is detected in the layout, and contains the `_compressed_br` string.

#### Support for in-place compression

This mode is to be preferred for web servers that support `accept-encoding` header file rewriting. In the case of [**Azure Static WebApps**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal), if a file next to the original one is suffixed with `.br`, and the client requested for brotli compressed files, the in-place compressed file will be served.

#### Support for IIS / Azure Webapp GZip/Brotli pre-compression
The IIS compression support has too many knobs for the size of generated WebAssembly files, which
makes the serving of static files inefficient.

The Bootstrapper tooling will generate two folders `_compressed_gz` and `_compressed_br` which contain compressed versions of the main files. A set IIS rewriting rules are used to redirect the queries to the requested pre-compressed files, with a preference for Brotli.

When building an application, place [the following file](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap/blob/main/src/Uno.Wasm.SampleNet6/wwwroot/web.config) in the `wwwroot` folder to automatically enable the use of pre-compressed files.

Note that the pre-compressed files are optional, and if the rewriting rules are removed or not used (because the site is served without IIS), the original files are available at their normal locations.

### Node.js support

The bootstrapper supports having a project loaded as part of a node application. To do so:

- Create a Wasm bootstrapper project, named `MyApp.Wasm`
- Create a Node.js TypeScript project in Visual Studio, named `MyApp.Runner`
- In boostrapper project, add the following :
  ```xml
  <WasmShellDistPath>../MyApp.Runner/app</WasmShellDistPath>
  <WasmShellMode>node</WasmShellMode>
  ```
- In the `app.ts`, add the following:
  ```js
  require("./app/mono");
  ```

Run the application and the main method of the `MyApp.Wasm` will be executed.

The parameters of the node command line are provided to the app's main method when running the app as follows:

```
node app param1 param2
```

An example of the node.js support is available in the `Uno.Wasm.Node.Sample` and `Uno.Wasm.Node.Sample.Runner.njsproj` projects.

### Browser Embedded mode

By default, the project is launched with a HTML page (`index.html`). This mode is used for SPAs (Single Page Applications), but does not allow embedding into an existing webpage or application.

It is possible to use the Browser Embedded mode to allow the launching using JavaScript instead.

1. Add this line in your project file:

   ``` xml
   <WasmShellMode>BrowserEmbedded</WasmShellMode>
   ```

   The `embedded.js` file will be generated instead of `index.html`, containing the required code to launch the application.

2. In the HTML where you want to host the application, add the following:
   Using HTML:

   ``` html
   <div id="uno-body" />
   <script src="https://path.to/your/wasm/app/embedded.js" />
   ```

   Using a script:

   ``` javascript
   // you must ensure there's a <div id="uno-body" /> present in the DOM before calling this:
   import("https://path.to/your/wasm/app/embedded.js");
   ```

   

#### Important notes about Browser Embedded mode:

* There is no script isolation mechanisms, meaning that the application will have access to the same context and global objects.
* Loading more than one Uno bootstrapped application in the same page will conflict and produce unwanted results. A workaround would be to use a `<iframe>`.
* It may be required to add **CORS headers** to the application hosting website to allow the download and execution of scripts from it. It's already allowed in the development server shipped with Uno Bootstrapper.

### Support for additional JS files

Providing additional JS files is done through the inclusion of `EmbeddedResource`  msbuild item  files, in a project folder named `WasmScripts`.
Files are processed as embedded resources to allow for libraries to provide javascript files.

### Support for additional CSS files
Additional CSS files are supported through the inclusion of `EmbeddedResource`  msbuild item files, in a project folder named `WasmCSS`.

### Support for additional Content files
Additional Content files are supported through the inclusion of `Content` files. The folder structure is preserved in the output `dist` folder. There is 3 deployment modes for content files:

* `Package`: files using `UnoDeploy="Package"` mode will be deployed in the `dist\package_<hash>` folder and the folder structure will be preserved. This is the default mode for most files (see exclusions below).
* `Root`: files using `UnoDeploy="Root"` mode will be deployed directly in the `dist\` folder and the folder structure will be preserved.
* `None`: files using the `UnoDeploy="None"` mode will be ignored and won't be deployed.

Exclusions:

1. Files in the `WasmScript` folder will be set as `UnoDeploy="None"` by default (they are not treat as content)

2. Files in the `wwwroot` folder will be set as `UnoDeploy="Root"` by default

3. You can manually set the _deploy mode_ in the `.csproj` in the following way:

   ```xml
   <ItemGroup>
       <!-- Manually set a file to be deployed as "root" mode -->
       <Content Include="Path\To\My\File.txt" UnoDeploy="Root" />
   
       <!-- Manually set a file to be deployed as "package" mode -- overriding the default "root" mode for wwwroot -->
       <Content Include="wwwroot\config.json" UnoDeploy="Package" />
   
       <!-- Manually set a file to be deployed as "none" mode (not deployed) -->
       <Content Include="wwwroot\output.log" UnoDeploy="None" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

Asset files: `dist/package_XXXX/uno-assets.txt` contains the package relative paths of the content files that were copied to the  `dist/package_XXXX` folder. It can be used to identify which assets are packaged with the application at runtime and avoid costly probing operations. Important: Will only contain files deployed in `UnoDeploy="Package"` mode.

A few files extensions are excluded (`UnoDeploy="None")`by default such as `*.a`, `*.bc`.
 `.html` files are those named `web.config` will default to `UnoDeploy="Root"`.

> **IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT BROWSER CACHE:** Browsers will often cache files based on their final url. When deploying a file in the `UnoDeploy="Root"` mode, beware the browser could cache the previous version. Files the the `UnoDeploy="Package"` mode won't have this problem since the path name contains a hash of their content. It important to take that into consideration when deciding to use the `UnoDeploy="Root"` mode.

### Support for deep-linking / routes

By default, deep-linking is not enabled to allow deployed apps to be hosted at any deployed locations. Anchor based navigation is supported by default, as it does not impact the path part of the URI.

To enable deep-linking or routes, add the following parameter to your project:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <WasmShellWebAppBasePath>/</WasmShellWebAppBasePath>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This will for the all requests made to the bootstrapper's support files to be read from this path, regardless of the depth of the path. This way an address like `https://example.com/route1/item1` will be supported, assuming that the application is hosted at the root of the host.

One example of such support is done through the [Azure Static WebApps](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/guides/azure-static-webapps.html) support, using navigation fallback:

```json
{
  "navigationFallback": {
    "rewrite": "/index.html",
    "exclude": ["/package_*"]
  }
}
```

This parameter can be configured on build by using a command-line parameter as follows:

```bash
dotnet build "/p:WasmShellWebAppBasePath=/"
```

### Support for PWA Manifest File
A **Progressive Web App** manifest link definition can be added to the index.html file's head:
- Use the `WasmPWAManifestFile` property to set the file name
- Add a [Web App Manifest file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-chromium/get-started#step-2---create-a-web-app-manifest).
- Ensure the build action is `Content` for this file so it gets copied to the output folder. The `UnoDeploy="Package"` mode (which is the default) must be used. This file must not be put in the `wwwroot` folder.
- Create a set of icons using the [App Image Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)

iOS's support for home screen icon is optionally set by searching for a 1024x1024 icon in the 
PWA manifest. Not providing this image will make iOS generate a scaled-down screenshot of the application.

You can validate your PWA in the [chrome audits tab](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/05/devtools-release-notes#lighthouse). If your 
PWA has all the appropriate metadata, the PWA installer will prompt to install your app.

### Support for Subresource Integrity
By default, the _msbuild task_ will calculate a hash for binary files in your project and will use the [Subresource Integrity](https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/)
to validate that the right set of files are loaded at runtime.

You can deactivate this feature by setting this property in your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<WashShellUseFileIntegrity>False</WashShellUseFileIntegrity>
```

### Support for Content prefetching
The `WashShellGeneratePrefetchHeaders` controls the generation of `<link rel="prefetch" />` nodes in the index.html header.

It is enabled by default and allows for the browser to efficiently fetch the applications
webassembly and .NET assemblies files, while the JavaScript and WebAssembly runtimes are 
being initialized.

This prefetching feature is particularly useful if the http server supports HTTP/2.0.

## Environment variables
Mono provides the ability to configure some features at initialization, such as logging or GC.

To set those variables, add the following to your project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <WasmShellMonoEnvironment Include="MONO_GC_PARAMS" Value="soft-heap-limit=512m,nursery-size=64m,evacuation-threshold=66,major=marksweep" />
  <WasmShellMonoEnvironment Include="MONO_LOG_LEVEL" Value="debug" />
  <WasmShellMonoEnvironment Include="MONO_LOG_MASK" Value="gc" />
</ItemGroup>
```

These lines change the configuration of the GC and logging, to determine when a GC occurs. More options are available 
in the `Environment Variables` section of [the mono documentation](http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=man%3amono(1)). 

### Configuration Environment Variables
The bootstrapper provides a set of environment variables that reflect the configuration provided at build time:

- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_MONO_RUNTIME_MODE`, which specifies the runtime mode configuration (see above for valid values)
- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_LINKER_ENABLED`, which is set to `True` if the linker was enabled, otherwise `False`
- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_DEBUGGER_ENABLED`, which is set to `True` if the debugging support was enabled, otherwise `False`
- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_MONO_RUNTIME_CONFIGURATION`, which provides the mono runtime configuration, which can be can either be `release` or `debug`.
- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_MONO_PROFILED_AOT`, which specifies if the package was built using a PG-AOT profile.
- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_APP_BASE`, which specifies the location of the app content from the base. Useful to reach assets deployed using the `UnoDeploy="Package"` mode.
- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_WEBAPP_BASE_PATH`, which specifies the base location of the webapp. This parameter is used in the context of deep-linking (through the `WasmShellWebAppBasePath` property). This property must contain a trailing `/` and its default is `./`.
- `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_EMSCRIPTEN_MAXIMUM_MEMORY`, which optionally specifies the maximum memory available to the WebAssembly module. 

Those variables can be accessed through [Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.getenvironmentvariable).

### 4GB memory support

The support for 4GB memory space is available by adding the following configuration:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
	<WasmShellExtraEmccFlags Include="-s MAXIMUM_MEMORY=4GB"/>
</ItemGroup>
```
The configuration can also be detected at runtime using the `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_EMSCRIPTEN_MAXIMUM_MEMORY` environment variable, which will be set to `4GB` once set.

See this [blog post from the v8 team](https://v8.dev/blog/4gb-wasm-memory) for more information.

### Dependency management
The Uno Bootstrapper uses RequireJS for dependency management, allowing for dependencies to be resolved in a stable manner. 

For instance, a script defined this way, placed in the `WasmScripts` folder:

```javascript
define(() => {
    var txt = document.createTextNode("Loaded !");
    var parent = document.getElementById('uno-body');
    parent.insertBefore(txt, parent.lastChild);
});
```

will be executed appropriately.

Dependencies can also be declared this way: 

```javascript
define([], function() { return MyModule; });
```

If you're taking a dependency on an [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) enabled library, you'll need to publish the library as it would outside of the normal require flow.

As an example, to be able to use [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/):
- Add the `html2canvas.js` file as an `EmbeddedResource` in the `WasmScripts` folder
- Then create an additional file called `myapp.js`, also as an `EmbeddedResource`
  ```
  require([`${config.uno_app_base}/html2canvas`], c => window.html2canvas = c);
  ```
- You'll then be able to access `window.html2canvas` from C# using `eval()`.

### Dependency management for Emscripten

Emscripten modules initialization is performed in an asynchronous way and the Bootstrapper 
will ensure that a dependency that exposes a module will have finished its initialization 
for starting the `Main` method of the C# code.

### Index.html content override
The msbuild property `WasmShellIndexHtmlPath` can be used to specify the path of a project-specific `index.html` file.

You can set it as follows, given there's an `index.html` file at the root of your project:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <WasmShellIndexHtmlPath>index.html</WasmShellIndexHtmlPath>
</PropertyGroup>
```

This file should contain the following markers, for the runtime to initialize properly: 
- `$(ADDITIONAL_CSS)`
- `$(ADDITIONAL_HEAD)`

You can use these files as an example:
- [Templates/index.html](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap/blob/main/src/Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap/Templates/index.html) when using the bootstrapper 4.x builds.
- [Templates/index.html](https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap/blob/release/stable/3.3/src/Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap/Templates/index.html) when using the bootstrapper 3.3.x builds.

## Splash screen customization

The default configuration for the bootstrapper is to show the Uno Platform logo. This can be changed, along with the background color and progress bar color by doing the following:

- Create an AppManifest.js file in the `WasmScripts` folder
- Set its build action to `EmbeddedResource`
- Add the following content:
```
var UnoAppManifest = {
    splashScreenImage: "https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/img/winui-logo.png",
    splashScreenColor: "#00f",
    accentColor: "#f00",
    displayName: "WinUI App"
}
```

These properties are supported in the manifest:
- `lightThemeBackgroundColor` (optional) to change the light theme background color
- `darkThemeBackgroundColor` (optional)to change the dark theme background color
- `splashScreenColor` to change the background color regardless of the theme. When set to `transparent`, `lightThemeBackgroundColor` and `darkThemeBackgroundColor` will be used, otherwise the default browser background color will be used.

Once the app start, the content will be updated to show the custom logo. The logo must be of size 630x300 (or same ratio).

### Configuration of the runtime
- The msbuild property `MonoRuntimeDebuggerEnabled` can be set to `true` to allow for mono to output additional debugging details, and have the debugger enabled (not supported yet by the mono tooling).
- The msbuild property `MonoWasmRuntimeConfiguration` allows for the selection of the debug runtime but is mainly used for debugging the runtime itself. The value can either be `release` or `debug`.

### Overriding the .NET WebAssembly SDK build
The msbuild property `NetCoreWasmSDKUri` allow the override of the default SDK path. The path can be a local file or remote file.

To select a different sdk build:
- For `net5` projects:
    - Generate a build from the `https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.DotnetRuntime.WebAssembly` project
    - Copy the `dotnet-runtime-wasm-XX-XX-Release.zip` uri or local zip file path to the `NetCoreWasmSDKUri` property

> Note that override properties require a zip file as the source, not an uncompressed folder.

If you are overriding the contents of the uncompressed SDK folder, for debugging purposes, you will need to set the `WasmShellDisableSDKCheckSumValidation` property to true to avoid the bootstrapper to recreate the SDK folder.

### Changing the .NET SDKs install location
The SDKs are installed under `Path.GetTempPath()` by default, you may change this by setting the following msbuild property(or environment variable): `WasmShellMonoTempFolder`.

For example, on Windows, setting `WasmShellMonoTempFolder` to `C:\MonoWasmSDKs`, the `mono-wasm-e351637985e` sdk would be installed under `C:\MonoWasmSDKs\mono-wasm-e351637985e`
instead of `C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Temp\mono-wasm-e351637985e`.

### Windows Long Path support
The bootstrapper supports Windows 10 long paths by default, but there may be cases where the `\\?\` [path format](https://web.archive.org/web/20160818035729/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jeremykuhne/2016/06/21/more-on-new-net-path-handling/) may not be supported.

In such a case, setting the `<WasmShellEnableLongPathSupport>false</WasmShellEnableLongPathSupport>` in the project file can disable this feature.

Additional documentation on the support for long paths [is available here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#enable-long-paths-in-windows-10-version-1607-and-later).

### WSL Integration for Windows 10

The integration with WSL provides a way for using AOT, Mixed mode or external bitcode support using Windows 10.

This feature is active only if one of those condition is true:
- The `WasmShellMonoRuntimeExecutionMode` property is `FullAOT` or `InterpreterAndAOT
- There is a `*.bc` or `*.a` file in the `Content` item group
- The `WasmShellForceUseWSL` is set to `true`

Otherwise, the WSL integration is not used and the mono runtime present in the SDK is used as-is.

### Nuget package runtime overrides
By default, when presented with an assembly present in both the runtime and a nuget package, the bootstrapper will favor the runtime's version of the assembly. This is generally required to avoid internal consistency errors with the runtime.

In some rare cases though, it may still be required to override the runtime's version. To do this, you'll need to add the following to your csproj:
```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- Note that the assembly file must include the .dll extension -->
  <WasmShellRuntimeCopyExclude Include="System.Text.Json.dll"/>
</ItemGroup>
```
This will ensure that the System.Text.Json.dll assembly coming from an explicit `PackageReference` will be favored over the runtime version.

## Memory Profiling
Managed Memory profiling is available through the use of the [Xamarin Profiler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/tools/profiler) or [`mprof-report`](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/debug+profile/profile/profiler/#analyzing-the-profile-data).

Memory snapshots are supported to enable memory difference analysis and find memory leaks.

### Using the memory profiler

- Add the following to your csproj 
  ```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <WasmShellEnableLogProfiler>true</WasmShellEnableLogProfiler>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

Once the application is running:
- Use the `Shift+Alt+H` (`Shift+Cmd+H` on macOS) hotkey to create memory snapshots 
- Use the `Shift+Alt+P` (`Shift+Cmd+P` on macOS) hotkey to save the profile to a file

With the saved `mlpd` file, you can either:
- Open it with the Xamarin Profiler (which needs to be explicitly installed in the VS 2022 installer)
- Show a memory report using `mprof-report`. The tool can be installed under Ubuntu WSL using `sudo apt install mono-utils`

### Additional profiler configuration

The profiler uses the [official configuration string](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/debug+profile/profile/profiler/#profiler-option-documentation), which can be adjusted using the following options:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <WasmShellEnableLogProfiler>true</WasmShellEnableLogProfiler>
  <WasmShellLogProfilerOptions>log:alloc,output=output.mlpd</WasmShellLogProfilerOptions>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Note that as of .NET 6:
- The support for any timer based profiling is not supported, because of the lack of threading support in .NET
- The support for remote control of the profiler is not supported

## CPU Profiling 

To enable the profiling of the WebAssembly code, set te following parameter:

```xml
<WasmShellEnableEmccProfiling>true</WasmShellEnableEmccProfiling>
```

This will ensure that the toolchain keeps the function names so that the browser shows meaningful information in the **Performance** tab.

Note that code executed through the interpreter will not appear explicitly in the performance charts, as it is executed through the interpreter. Only AOTed code will be visible.

## Native memory troubleshooting

To enable native memory troubleshooting, it is possible to use [LLVM's sanitizer](https://emscripten.org/docs/debugging/Sanitizers.html) feature.

To enable it, add the following to your project file:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
	<WasmShellExtraEmccFlags Include="-fsanitize=address" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This will allow for malloc/free and other related memory access features to validate for possible issues, like this one:

```
================================================================= dotnet.js:2498:16
==42==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: attempting free on address which was not malloc()-ed: 0x03116d80 in thread T0 dotnet.js:2498:16

```

Showing that mono is trying to free some memory pointer that was never returned by `malloc`.

Note that the runtime performance is severely degraded when enabling this feature.

### musl weak aliases override

In some cases, the [musl library](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/tree/aa66f92b790c8d319d1599d44657a6305bf74a8a/system/lib/libc/musl) performs out-of-bounds reads which can be [detected as false positives](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/7279#issuecomment-734934021) by ASAN's checkers.

In such cases, providing alternate non-overflowing versions of [weak aliased MUSL functions](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/aa66f92b790c8d319d1599d44657a6305bf74a8a/system/lib/libc/musl/src/string/stpncpy.c#L31) is possible through the `WasmShellNativeCompile` feature of the bootstrapper.

For example, `strncpy` can be overriden by a custom implementation as follows:

```c
char *__stpncpy(char *restrict d, const char *restrict s, size_t n)
{
	for (; n && (*d=*s); n--, s++, d++);
	memset(d, 0, n);
	return d;
}
```

in a C file defined in your project and imported through `WasmShellNativeCompile`.
