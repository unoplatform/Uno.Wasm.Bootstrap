# Support for WebAssembly Threads

> [!CAUTION]
> Threading support is experimental, and .NET 9 support [has changed the main thread's ability to execute managed code](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/85592#issuecomment-2031876112). As a result, the support in the Uno Bootstrapper is limited to simple DOM interactions, and is not supported on Uno Platform UI apps.

Starting from .NET 7, experimental support for [WebAssembly threads](https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads/blob/master/proposals/threads/Overview.md) has been included. This support is provided by the bootstrapper 7.0 and later, for interpreter and AOT modes. The following documentation explains how to enable threading.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Threading support is now supported in most major browsers. You can find out if your target browser supports it on the [WebAssembly roadmap](https://webassembly.org/roadmap).

## Enabling threads

Add the following to your WebAssembly project:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <WasmShellEnableThreads>true</WasmShellEnableThreads>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Threading support can be detected at runtime by using the [`UNO_BOOTSTRAP_MONO_RUNTIME_FEATURES`](features-environment-variables.md) environment variable.

## Controlling the browser thread pool size

By default, the runtime pre-creates a set of 4 WebWorkers available to WebAssembly threads, and the .NET Runtime will reuse the workers as threads stop. This value is used by the `ThreadPool` and `Tasks` subsystems.

To change the number of threads available to the app, use the following:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <WasmShellPThreadsPoolSize>8</WasmShellPThreadsPoolSize>
</PropertyGroup>
```

The maximum number of threads can be determined by the `UNO_BOOTSTRAP_MAX_THREADS` environment variable.

## Restrictions

WebAssembly Threads are using the `SharedArrayBuffer` browser feature, which is disabled in most cases for security reasons.

To enable `SharedArrayBuffer`, your website will need to provide the following headers:

```http
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

If you're using resources from another origin, that origin should also be serving the following header to accept being loaded by the app:

```http
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin
```

See [here additional information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy) about this header.

You can find [more information about threading on the Chrome Developer blog](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/enabling-shared-array-buffer/).

If you're using [`dotnet serve`](https://github.com/natemcmaster/dotnet-serve) or any other similar server package to serve your application, you can use the following:

```sh
dotnet serve -p 8000 -h "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp" -h "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin"
```
